# Horiseon Accessibility Redesign

## Description
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Expected Outcome
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


## Usage
Updates will improve accessibility of website by ensuring all links work, tabbing/shift-tabbing follow a logical progression around the website, color contracts are of an acceptable ratio, and all links/images have alt text tags.
